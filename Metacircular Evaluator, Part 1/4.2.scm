;; Louis Reasoner plans to reorder the cond clauses in eval so that the 
;; clause for procedure applications appears before the clause for 
;; assignments. He argues that this will make the interpreter more efficient: 
;; Since programs usually contain more applications than assignments, 
;; definitions, and so on, his modified eval will usually check fewer clauses 
;; than the original eval before identifying the type of an expression.

;; a. What is wrong with Louis's plan? (Hint: What will Louis's evaluator 
;; do with the expression (define x 3)?)

; Expressions like (define x 3) will be regarded as an application, 
; while they are an assignment.

;; b. Louis is upset that his plan didn't work. He is willing to go to any 
;; lengths to make his evaluator recognize procedure applications before it 
;; checks for most other kinds of expressions. Help him by changing the 
;; syntax of the evaluated language so that procedure applications start 
;; with call. For example, instead of (factorial 3) we will now have to 
;; write (call factorial 3) and instead of (+ 1 2) we will have to write 
;; (call + 1 2). 

(define (eval exp env)
  (cond ((eq? (car exp) 'call)
         (apply (cadr exp) (cddr exp))))
  ; ...
  )
